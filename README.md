# Swapi-Refactor

A refactor of the Swapi-box project, which uses the Star Wars API to display film, people, planet, and vehicle data based on the category selected by the user. The user has the ability to view the first ten items of each category on the screen on individual cards. The user is able to favorite a card and view their favorited cards on a dedicated page.

Uses a custom hook to separate business logic from view components, leveraging React hooks (useState, useEffect).

## To Use

Clone down this repo

`npm install`

`npm start`

To view data, simply click the button that corresponds to the category that you choose. Each item is able to be favorited with a button.

The user can change category at any time.
